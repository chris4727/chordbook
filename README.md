## Useage

A new chordsheet can be created by copying the `template.cho` file to a new file.

Chordsheets are named with the format `{Artist} - {Song title}.cho`

A `.cho` file can be converted to `.pdf` by using the `chordbook` script found in the `bin` repository

A chordbook can be created using a text file containing a list of all .cho files to be included in the final chordbook.
